# git-enlightened
ONEXENIUS is a neat Enlightenment build script for Ubunteros!

This script allows you to safely and easily download, install, update the GIT
master version of Enlightenment 0.22 (aka E22) on Ubuntu Xenial Xerus
and Zesty Zapus; or helps you perform a clean uninstall of E22 GIT.

Getting started:

Click the green "Clone or download" button.

If you choose to clone this repository, first make sure the git program is installed
on your system,
then run the following command in Terminal:

git clone https://github.com/batden/git-enlightened.git

The installation instructions are contained in the script itself
(open onexenius.sh in a text editor like Gedit).

To stay up to date with the latest repository changes, cd to the git-enlightened folder
then simply run:

git pull
